1. Create a dummy i3 ipc host which can send sequences of messages
2. Create test sequences for all fixed bugs
3. Use some framework to run the sequences
4. Keep sequences up to date



Tests:
- Create program i3_dummy, that iterates over lines in a sequence file (using libev to catch messages while waiting), returning on error
- Line format: send|receive, wait[min|max], message string // for sending, the min delay is used
- Errors:
	+ wrong message received
	+ message received out of the time interval
	+ no message received when one is expected
